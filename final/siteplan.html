            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p><strong>Bookmarked</strong></p>
            <p>
                <strong>Reasoning:</strong> This name was selected for its modern and memorable quality. It suggests the act of finding something valuable and worth returning to, which aligns perfectly with the goal of a book club: to discover and discuss noteworthy books.

            <p>
                The purpose of the <strong>Bookmarked</strong> website is to serve as the central online hub for our local reading group. It will provide essential information for members and attract new ones by showcasing our activities. The site will feature a homepage with our current and past reads (the "Bookshelf") and an events calendar, a "Join Us" page with a simple membership form, and a blog for member-led reviews and discussions.
